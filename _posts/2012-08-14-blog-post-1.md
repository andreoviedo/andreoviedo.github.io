Summary 
======

Synthetic identity fraud (SIF), in which perpetrators fabricate personas by combining genuine and fictitious personal data, now accounts for tens of billions in annual losses. By 2023, U.S. institutions reported over $35 billion in SIF-related write-offs and industry analysts forecast that generative-AI-enabled fraud losses could exceed $40 billion by 2027[^FED]. Deepfake media compounds this threat: criminals create video calls mimicking a company’s CFO, as in the case of a $25 million wire fraud orchestrated via a synthetic Zoom conference[^DEL], and clone voices to execute “vishing” scams against bank customers[^SEC]. Traditional remote onboarding—relying on static document uploads and basic liveness tests—and voice-print authentication are increasingly inadequate against advanced AI models that can simulate human blinking, facial movements, and natural speech with minimal artifacts.

These vulnerabilities are exacerbated by regulatory frameworks that predate generative AI. FinCEN’s CIP rules require institutions to form a “reasonable belief” as to a customer’s identity but do not prescribe modern defenses against synthetic media. Securities regulators rely on general anti-fraud authority only after manipulative schemes occur, while consumer-protection mandates ensure fairness but lack specific guidance on deepfake-related credit denials. The result is a regulatory environment in which institutions have discretion over identity-proofing methods but no shared baseline standard for defending against AI-driven deception.

Analysis of Existing Policies
------

FinCEN’s November 2024 alert on deepfake-assisted fraud provided valuable typologies and red flags but remains advisory. Its CIP requirements continue to mandate only basic document verification and record-keeping without explicit standards for biometric liveness checks or AI-powered detection tools. As a result, implementation among banks and fintechs is uneven, and smaller institutions often rely on third-party vendors whose methods vary widely in effectiveness.

The SEC and FINRA have issued investor alerts warning of AI-driven impersonations and market-manipulation risks, but these measures are enforced under existing securities-fraud statutes and apply only after harm has occurred[^SEC]. Broker-dealer onboarding remains subject to the same CIP obligations overseen by FinCEN, leaving the identity-proofing processes reactive rather than preventive. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) stresses that fraud-detection algorithms must comply with fair-lending and consumer-protection laws and cautions against “digital redlining,” yet it has not mandated bias audits or formal recourse mechanisms for consumers wrongly flagged as synthetic identities[^CFPB].

Other agencies, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC, have signaled concern about generative AI as an operational risk, and law enforcement bodies (FBI, Secret Service, FTC) issue deepfake warnings. However, coordination among regulators is informal, and many non-bank fintechs fall outside clear supervisory regimes. Without a unified framework, criminals can exploit jurisdictional ambiguities and repeatedly target multiple institutions with the same fabricated identity.

Recommendation
-----

I propose a comprehensive policy initiative led by FinCEN and backed by banking, securities, and consumer-protection regulators to modernize and unify identity-proofing standards. First, the CIP should be revised to require multi-factor remote onboarding, combining liveness-verified video biometrics, government database cross-checks (e.g., SSA’s electronic Consent Based Social Security Number Verification), and certified AI-based deepfake detection in all non-face-to-face account openings. These outcome-focused standards would be technology-neutral but enforceable, ensuring consistent adoption.

Second, a FinCEN-hosted intelligence-sharing platform, protected under Section 314(b) of the USA PATRIOT Act safe harbor, should facilitate confidential exchange of emerging deepfake fraud indicators among banks, fintechs, and law enforcement. This hub could evolve into a synthetic-identity registry with privacy and accuracy safeguards, preventing criminals from reusing fake personas across institutions.

Third, the CFPB and banking regulators must issue guidance requiring periodic bias and accuracy audits for fraud-detection models, mandate clear adverse-action notices when accounts are denied, and ensure accessible appeal processes. These measures uphold fairness and transparency, preventing unintended harm to legitimate customers.

Fourth, federal support should be provided for R&D into advanced deepfake detection through grants and creation of a expert-led certification program for identity-verification vendors. Concurrently, enhanced statutory penalties for AI-enabled financial fraud and disruption of deepfake kit marketplaces will strengthen deterrence.

Finally, significant deepfake or synthetic-identity incidents must be reported to FinCEN via a designated suspicious activities report (SAR) code. Aggregated reporting will enable real-time analysis, swift regulatory feedback, and annual public progress reports tracking threat trends and institutional readiness.

Implementation Considerations
-------

This initiative requires coordination among FinCEN, the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, SEC, FINRA, and CFPB, with support from Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act if necessary. In Year 1, regulators would issue binding guidance and launch pilot programs with major banks and fintechs, while establishing the intelligence-sharing forum. Year 2 would see formal rulemaking, expansion to all regulated entities, compliance examinations, and funding for detection-technology grants. Year 3 and beyond would involve full enforcement, annual progress reporting, and iterative refinement of standards.

Potential obstacles include technology-cost burdens for community banks and smaller fintechs, which can be mitigated through phased timelines and government subsidies. Biometric data collection raises privacy concerns that must be addressed through transparent consent processes and secure data handling. Operational friction from enhanced onboarding may impact customer experience; clear communication about the protective purpose of these measures will help maintain trust.

# About me


I am a Peruvian quantitative developer with extensive experience at national-level financial regulatory policy, leveraging complex structured and un-structured financial data. During my time at the financial regulator, I was key to the implementation of various new developments leveraging various data streams such as the credit bureau, tax data, financial statements and regulatory reports for banks, insurance companies and pension funds. I pioneered the usage of open-source software such as R and Python
for day to day tasks, replacing the inefficient usage of Stata and Excel with a combination of SQL and a tailor-made library to connect the IDEs to our local database.

On the academic side of things, I am a big fan of computational methods, quantitative finance and econometrics. My undergrad was on Economics with a mention in Finance, I also hold a Masters in Public Policy from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy with a focus on finance, data analytics and quantitative methods, and am a CFA charterholder member of the Chicago CFA Society.

On my free time I like to code (yes, really). I also enjoy football, cycling and motorsports.
